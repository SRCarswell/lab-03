# Questioning data visualisations

## Image 1

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/Speaking-the-world.jpg")
```

_Write your comments about image 1 below_

Unclear the scale for each bar, are we measuring area or length.
China has different scale with an impossible value.



## Image 2

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/rose-pop-density-total-area-bw.jpg")
```

_Write your comments about image 2 below_

Unclear the values that are supposed to be represented. no scale


## Image 3

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/life-expectancy-rule-of-law.png")
```

_Write your comments about image 3 below_

Cramped, axis labelled but not given values, no clear colour coordination


## Image 4

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/global-income-dist.PNG")
```

_Write your comments about image 4 below_

x axis is logarithmic, to much information being presented at once.




# Exercises

```{r load-data-staff, message=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
staff <- read_csv("data/instructional-staff.csv")
```


## Exercise 1

What is the difference between *wide format* data and *long format* data?

Wide format has 1 row per entity, Long format has multiple rows per entity.  


Is the format `staff` data *wide* or *long*?

Wide


How many observations are there in the data set?

5


## Exercise 2

```{r pivoting}

staff_long <- staff %>%
  pivot_longer(
    cols = 2:12, 
    names_to = "year",
    values_to = "percent"
    ) %>% view()

```
